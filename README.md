## Wumpus World project - Artificial Intelligence 

### Notes
The agent is performing at maximum score levels for 4x4 to 7x7 board sizes. The agent avoids a wumpus and pits to search
and receive the gold. Once the gold is found, the score increases by +1000. Each move and turn taken is -1 to the score. 

This uses uniform cost search and probability analysis to maximize the heuristic.
